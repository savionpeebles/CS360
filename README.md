Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This application was designed to be an inventory app that users could use to store information about product levels in their small businesses or personal life. This app had 4 different screens, a login page, inventory page, SMS page and a recycle image viewer.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To support user needs to this app I had to incoporate a login screen for users to make and sign into accounts, a inventory page where users could add items, subtract items and create new counts for new products, a recycle image viewer where users could go to see items they have recycled or deleted off their inventory page and a SMS manager page where users would be asked for SMS permission. My UI designs were super simple so that the user would feel comfortable using the app and not overwhelmed by too many functions or an over the top theme.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

When it came to developing this application I strongly relied on the course material and my professor for any techniques or strategies I applied throughout this project. These techniques can be applied in the future easily because they are best coding practices and are needed for a sucessful career in computer science.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

My code came across some functionality issues due to this being my first time using android studio, but going through the struggles of trying to get everything to work really reinforced my knowledge when it comes to using this IDE. Testing was the biggest method when it came to finding out why my program wouldn't work and what it would take to fix it.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate by asking my professor for help truly, That is not typically something I would do as I feel like my knowledge and resources guide me a lot of the time. Going out of my way to ask for help saved me in this class and opened my eyes to how helpful it can be if I am truly stuck.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe I was very successful in implementing the propee design for my user. It felt seamless and worked very smoothly in the app. Considering that was one of my weaknesses coming into the course I feel a lot better about my design ability in general now
